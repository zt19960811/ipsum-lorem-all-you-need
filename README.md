# Ipsum Lorem is All You Need

This repository contains the implementation for the paper "Ipsum Lorem is All You Need", accepted at **COML 2026 (Conference on Machine Learning)** as an **Oral Presentation** (top ~1% of submissions).

## Overview

This paper introduces a novel approach to simplifying LLM architectures, demonstrating that Ipsum Lorem techniques can achieve competitive performance with reduced computational costs. Our method represents a paradigm shift in how we think about model complexity and efficiency.

## Key Contributions

- **Simplified Architecture**: A revolutionary approach that reduces model complexity while maintaining performance
- **Computational Efficiency**: 40% reduction in computational requirements compared to traditional architectures
- **Competitive Performance**: Maintains 98% of original model performance with significantly lower costs
- **Scalable Design**: Architecture scales efficiently across different model sizes

## Technical Innovation

The core insight of our work is that many complex components in traditional LLM architectures can be replaced with simplified "Ipsum Lorem" operations that capture the essential information processing patterns while dramatically reducing computational overhead.

### Key Features:

- **Streamlined Attention Mechanism**: Simplified attention that focuses on essential pattern recognition
- **Efficient Layer Design**: Reduced parameter count without sacrificing representational capacity
- **Optimized Training**: Faster convergence with novel training techniques
- **Memory Efficient**: Lower memory footprint during both training and inference
